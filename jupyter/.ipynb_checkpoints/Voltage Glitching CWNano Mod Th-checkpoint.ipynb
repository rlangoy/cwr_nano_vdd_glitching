In this lab, we'll do some simple glitch tests on the Nano's target board, showing how to scan through glitch settings and seeing what effect it has on the hardware.*\n",

    "Digital hardware devices have certain voltage and clock requirements to function properly. If these requirements are not met, the device can fail to function, or even be damage. By shorting the voltage pins of a microcontroller for controlled, short periods of time, we can cause it to behave erratically, clearning registers and skipping instructions.  Such attacks can be immensely powerful in practice.
